# trisecureaccesssystem_pde4432

The TriSecure Access System - PDE4432 is a project repository that contains the sample codes used during every phase of the project. This was done to ensure all the components work on their own before implementing them with all the other components.

The project also contains the two final codes used - for the rfid uno and the regular uno. they were connected to each other via serial communication.
